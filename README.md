# amari

To make 'components' and 'pipelines' more human for users who have to use AML.

Amari is intended to be a plug-and-play library that fits *just fits* inside your existing codebase. New components may be written with Amari without having to change existing components or pipelines. We plan on supporting code generation so that you can instead of checking in 'meta-code' into compliant or reviewed repos, check-in compiled code that looks exactly as ugly as AML pipeline code you would have written by hand.
